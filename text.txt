o Interquartile Range or IQR is used to measure
  how spread out the data points in a set are from the mean of the data set
o The higher the IQR, 
  the more spread out the data points; 
  in contrast, the smaller the IQR, the more bunched up 
  the data points are around the mean.

To calculate the IQR there are 4 simple steps. 
1. Order the data from least to greatest. 
2. Find the mean.
3. Calculate the median of both the lower and upper half of the data. 
4. The IQR is the difference between the upper and lower medians.

o Pandas has a quantile function which does all this for us.
  Pandas dataframe.quantile() this function returns the data 
  frame where the index is q, columns of 
  self (It will take the names of the columns as they are) 
  and values will be the quantiles.
